  <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
  Your participation in this research, which aims to better understand the charging strategies adopted by electric vehicle drivers in various climatic conditions, would be greatly appreciated. However, before agreeing to participate in this project and signing this information and consent form, please take the time to read this form. It will help you understand what your potential participation in the research entails so that you can make an informed decision.<br /><br />
  This form may contain words you do not understand. We encourage you to ask any questions you deem useful to the researcher leading this research project or a member of their research team. Feel free to ask them to explain any words or information that is unclear. Take all the time you need to read and understand this form before making your decision.
</p>



<p>
  <strong>Objectives of the Research Project</strong><br />
  This doctoral research has three main goals:<br />
  1. Model various aspects of electric vehicle charging and battery aging under different climatic conditions;<br />
  2. Conduct experiments under different climatic conditions to validate the resulting model;<br />
  3. Produce a best practices guide for electric vehicle charging. These best practices aim to both reduce vehicle charging times and extend battery life.<br /><br />
  It is in the context of this third objective that electric vehicle drivers are being approached. At this point in the research, modeling and experiments are advanced. To produce the best practices guide, we need to meet with electric vehicle users to ask them to explain the strategies they employ when charging their electric vehicles. The results of these meetings will help us produce the best practices guide.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Nature and duration of your participation</strong><br />
  Participation consists of meeting with a team member for a one-on-one interview lasting up to 60 minutes. The interview will discuss your preferred strategies for charging your electric vehicle in different weather conditions. The interview can be held in person, on the UQTR Trois-Rivières campus, or remotely, via the Zoom platform (at your choice), at a time convenient to you. The interview will be recorded (audio only) to facilitate transcription and analysis. Your voice will never be broadcast.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Risks and disadvantages:<br /></strong>
  There is no risk associated with your participation. The only drawback is the time spent on the project, which is a maximum of one hour.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Advantages or benefits:</strong><br />
  The contribution to the advancement of knowledge about charging strategies for electric vehicles in various climatic conditions is the only expected benefit of your participation.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Compensation or incentive:</strong><br />
  No monetary compensation is granted.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Confidentiality:</strong><br />
  The data collected during this study are confidential and will not, under any circumstances, lead to your identification. Your confidentiality will be ensured by assigning a fictitious name or an alphanumeric code (e.g., P1 when referring to participant 1). The research results, which may be disseminated in the form of professional and scientific communications, professional and scientific articles, a best practices guide, and a thesis, will not allow participants to be identified.<br /><br />
  The data collected will be stored on a secure UQTR server and on an external hard drive in a locked cabinet in the office of one of the professors who is a member of the team. The only people who will have access to it will be members of the research team. All of these individuals have signed a confidentiality agreement. The data will be permanently deleted from the server and external hard drive two years after the end of the research, i.e., around the end of 2028.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Voluntary participation:</strong><br />
  Your participation in this study is voluntary. You are completely free to participate or not, to refuse to answer certain questions, or to withdraw at any time without prejudice and without having to provide an explanation.<br /><br />
  Consenting to participate in this project does not deprive you of any right to legal recourse in the event of research-related harm.
